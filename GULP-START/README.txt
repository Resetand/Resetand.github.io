The build is focused on working with the sass preprocessor (syntax scss);
The dev folder is your working folder.
The build folder is the finished project folder (ready for production).
The package uses the bower package manager. Files are installed in dev / libs and collected into separate files (separately
css and js), which are in build / css / libs.css and build / css / libs.js respectively


You must have node.js and the npm package manager (npm usually installed along with node.js).

1. Check node.js and npm (in node cmd --version / npm --version)
2. Install gulp globally  (npm install --global gulp-cli)
3. Go to the project folder in cmd and the print (npm i). All packages must be installed in auto mode (captures a specific time)
4. in cmd run the build (gulp)

In the final version, you simply work in the dev folder.
